# Linux_Academy_Docker_Guide
As awesome as the courses are at Linux Academy, I learn much more when I create my own reference and study guide. So here I will continuously translate and archive what I've learned throughout the proccess of learning Docker. 

Listed here is the order in which you will learn docker roughly based on the Linux Academy courses

## 1. [Docker Basics](Docker_Basics.md)
## 2. [Dockerfile, Builds & Noetwork Configurations](Dockerfile_Builds_Networks.md)
## 3. [Docker Commands & Structures](Docker_Commands_Structures.md)
## 4. [Docker Integration and Use Cases](Docker_Integration.md)
